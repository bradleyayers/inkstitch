Ink/Stitch stitch types can be roughly divided into three sections: stroke, satin and fill.

## Stroke
Stroke stitches can be used for: outlines, line art embroidery or to add details into your design.

### Bean Stitch
Bean stitch describes a repetition of running stitches back and forth. This would result in thicker threading.

### Zig-Zag Stitch
Zig-Zag stitches are a very basic option to create a simple zig-zag line. We recommend to use them only for straight lines, because they will not stitch nicely around edges. In most cases, you would prefer a satin column instead.

### Satin Column

Satin stitch is mostly used for borders, letters or small fill areas.

Ink/Stitch will draw zig-zags back and forth between two lines, while you can vary the thickness of the column as you like.

### E-Stitch

The biggest purpose for E-stitch is a simple but strong cover stitch for applique items. Mainly for baby cloths as their skin tends to be more sensitive.

### Circular Fill

Circular fill fills a shape with an embroidered spiral. The center of the spiral is positioned at the center of the shape. A target point can be used to define a custom spiral center.

### Legacy Fill

In legacy fill, the extension will still break up the shape into sections, each of which can be embroidered in one go. Then these sections will be fill-stitched one at a time, jumping directly between sections.
